An Application (__currently in development__) for [FreeCodeCamp.Org's](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-voting-app) "Build A Voting App" challenge.

##### Requirements:

  Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

  * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

  * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
  
  * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

  * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
  
  * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

  * User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

  * User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

  * User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
